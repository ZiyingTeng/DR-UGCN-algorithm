DR-UGCN Critical Nodes Identification Algorithm In Hypergraph

Amid the lack of unified definitions for hypergraph-related extensions, we propose two new characteristic metrics capturing multi-dimensional features and integrate them with a deep learning mechanism and a nonlinear propagation model to dynamically simulate information diffusion. This leads to the development of the DR-UGCN algorithm that identifies critical nodes by simultaneously considering their information propagation capacity and their impact on hypergraph connectivity when removed.
