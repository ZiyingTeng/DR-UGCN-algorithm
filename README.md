Enhangced-NuGNN Critical Nodes Identification Algorithm In Hypergraph

During the initial eigenvalue input phase, two random walk-based eigenvalue centrality measures—information entropy centrality and thermal centrality—were introduced to capture dynamic characteristics and integrate with static features, thereby providing the model with foundational insights.
However, owing to the inherent complexity, nonlinearity, and the challenges in interpreting the deep structural characteristics and connectivity properties of hypergraph structures, it becomes inherently difficult to delineate or define their intricate features through linear and simplistic approaches.
This consequently presents two significant challenges: 
1) the effective capture of hypergraph characteristics;
2) the precise identification of nodes within the hypergraph that can be more accurately designated as key nodes.
The algorithm predominantly adopts a black-box methodology, amalgamating feature labels with external validation derived from empirical simulations, thereby enabling the model to autonomously learn these complex interconnections to achieve a more robust ranking compared to those obtained through conventional fixed criteria.
Subsequently, the results are rigorously validated and interpreted from multiple perspectives and standards.
